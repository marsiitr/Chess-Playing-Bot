# Chess-Playing-Bot
## Abstract:

Our Idea, Chess Paying Robot is basically aimed for designing such a Arm that is semi-automated. This arm will play chess with humans and decide it's moves itself. By this bot we also want to compare human brain with a machine. Can human brain thinks faster and think ahead than a machine that can be explained. 

## Achnowledgement:

Special Thanks to him for his exemplary guidance, monitoring and constant encouragement throughout the Project.

## Motivation:

With the increasing trends in technology the concept of automation is increasingly being applied to various firlds. This is our small contribution into this. 

## Hardware:

The mechanical design of the bot includes mounting of:
### 1. METAL GEAR DUAL SHAFT 16KGCM SERVO MOTOR
### 2. Arduino UNO
### 3. L298 Motor Driver
### 4. High Torque Stepper Motor
### 5. Breadboard
### 6. 7806 Voltage Regulator
### 7. 12V Adapter
### 8. Aluminium Channels

## Mechanical Design:

The bot after mounting all the components, looks like shown in the images:
